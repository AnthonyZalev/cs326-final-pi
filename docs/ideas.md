# Innovative Idea

A web app to find open classrooms or spaces on campus to meet. This app will allow users to search for open spaces at specific times and see the availability of specific rooms. Users will be able to see where the rooms are located on campus via map, create events to unofficially hold the room, and see other campus official and unofficial events being held on campus.  

Our application is unlike any existing application.  


# Important Concepts

We plan to use this public API from 25Live to obtain data about buildings, rooms and scheduled events.
